# DISH: Disaster Intelligence Hub
DISH is an AI-powered disaster intelligence hub that leverages Fivetran, BigQuery, and Vertex AI to make global disaster data more accessible and actionable.
This project is originally inspired by the [Fivetran x Google Cloud Hackathon](https://ai-accelerate.devpost.com/). While not an official submission, it was developed independently to showcase how automated data pipelines and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with AI-assistant can transform raw disaster data into meaningful insights and visual analytics to support better decision-making.

## Project Overview
This project connects open disaster data from ReliefWeb API using the **Fivetran Connector SDK**, stores it in **BigQuery**, and powers a **Vertex AI–enabled RAG** workflow to generate insights and summaries for climate and disaster management.

### Key Features

🌐 Automated data extraction using Fivetran Connector SDK

☁️ Data warehousing and transformation in Google BigQuery

🧠 Context-aware document retrieval via Vertex AI Vector Search assisted by Gemini API for Query refinement

💬 Insight generation and summarization using Gemini API
